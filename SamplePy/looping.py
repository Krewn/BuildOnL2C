import time
# For is the simplest of loops. 
for(k in range(1,5)): # range(1,5) returns the set [1,2,3,4,5] 
	print("say "+str(k) )#Repeated action where k first = 1
	time.sleep(0.6) # dramatic pause
# The Variable k is created for the loop, 
# iterating through 5 repetitions of the 
# indented code with  k equaling 1 for the 
# first run through than 2 than 3 and so on.
